# It Group PHP Developer Technical Task

From Anatoliy Danchuk.
Real tasks have a goal and vision for the future, as well as agreements that directly influence the development 
result. If there is no - I ask, or independently understand, depending on the circumstances.

I made the assumption that the task is to determine if there is minimal knowledge, how to explain my decisions 
in the interview, and what bi has changed in approach if you enter your context into the task.

I show:
* classes, interfaces, property access 
* magic method  
* static variables
* throw errors
* DRY
* comments, todo and warnings, markdown
* psr code style by phpstorm
* composer
* **TODO**: docker
* **TODO**: PHPUnit


## Overview

Hello %username%. Here would be your start point in big company. This task is like a game and I hope it would
be interesting. In any case, imagine a zoo. It contains animals. Animals like birds, fish, etc. These animals have 
their abilities, for instance, birds can fly, fish can swim, monkeys can walk. Every animal has to eat, that's why 
every animal has such ability. There are several issues and we hope you'd solve them for us.
