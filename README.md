# How check result
- checkout repo
- run docker compose
- go to http://0.0.0.0:8099/ on host machine
- see result
- run php unit test

# Finalised files:
- src/GlobalFunction/GlobalFunctionLib/Base/CreateObject.php
- apache.conf
- Dockerfile

# Architecture design
- not mix up "functions" with "entity". Easy for:
  - write fully exhaustive small tests, 
  - load viewed code in mind and unload unnecessary ones, 
  - safely reusing without refactor now of in future, 
  - omnifarious inherits without inherits unnecessary properties or methods, 
  - easy review - what fully exhaustive affect do changes.
  - easy see what changed
  
  - "entity" is collection of properties. 
    Exclude from rule is method Init/__construct when setted default values for properties.
  
  - "function" only do something with "entities", for example changed them.
  
- Not use any construction twice. Exclude situation where it is really necessary.
  Benefits: 
  - Minimise time for scale app using uniform objects/functions.
  - Minimise time for testing new features because need test only new feature, 
    without existed setters, getters, and other reusable functions.
  - Make injection very easy - all same actions is implemented in one place.
  - Really increase affect from previous rule. 
  
  Example:
  
  - instead many "new <class>" 
    use $this->lib->createObject(<class>::class)
    
  - instead of add method setName to many classes 
    create function $this->lib->setName($object, $name)

- Not add more than 1 public method to 1 class.
  Benefits:
  - files will be more readable.
  - functions wil be more isolated. Easy for testing, understanding, reusing.
  - autoload only really used functions. Tiny increasing of speed, really decrease of required RAM. 
  - help to follow last previous rule.
  - really increase affect from first rule.
  You can use $this->lib for call another classes.

- Use functions by property $lib, and create Objects by $this->lib->CreateFunctionalObject(<class>).
  Global object with access to all project's functions existed in all necessary objects as property $lib.  
  Benefits:
  - is available substituting any function in any necessary moment and place.
  - it implements second rule.


# Especially files
- test/Lib/CreateObject/CreateObjectBaseTest.php as example of easy check and for remember:
  - what class has changed namespace (specially or accidentally(!))
  - what class has ceased to exist.
- test/Lib/CreateObject/CreateObjectAdditionalTest.php as example of right relations in tests:
  - tests where called method "run" have not reason call 
    while test for method "run" is not successfully. 
  - when possible used DRY for tests.  
  - used data providers for compact cover of most possible situations.

# Especially property $lib
Exist in most classes.
Give access to most project's functions.
     
# Useful test    
   - /test/indexTest.php verify stdout and stderr after call public/index.php.

# Integrated thoughts in the project:
- comment thoughts in appropriate places. It helps to self and another developer 
  to right and fully understand all risk before edited the code.
  - Comments answer on questions
    - why next code/directive need there ? 
    - why it is best way ?
    - what to do there in future and why ? by @todo
    - when modified code ? Comment with @since. 
    - who modified code ? Comment with @author. Who can help.
    
    Examples:
    - apache.conf
    - src/GlobalFunction/GlobalFunctionLib/Base/CreateObject.php
    - Dockerfile
    
  - Marked by @deprecated and @since before delete unused functions/files. 
    And set @todo for resolve situation. 
    
    Examples: 
    - src/Alib.php
    
  - Add @see to link hidden related files/methods/classes/...
    
    Examples: 
    - src/GlobalFunction/IGlobalFunction.php
    
  - Add @uses to link hidden implemented files/methods/classes.
    
    Examples:
    - src/GlobalFunction/GlobalFunction.php
     
- namespace alike "<unique_vendor>/<unique_package>" is best way 
  of make accessible all current project's classes to any another project.
  For this project it is DanchukAS\AmadeusTechTask123.
  For test of this project it is DanchukAS\AmadeusTechTask123Test. 
  @todo Add namespace to all files.
  
- namespaces for type of entities is good 
  for identify, differ from another class with same or similar names.
        
- but namesplaces like PSR-4 is not really necessary there. 
  Auto generating class map give more freedom to refactor 
  alike adding intermediate file directory without manipulation with longer namespace.
  
  Examples: 
  - directory src/GlobalFunction,
  - directory src/GlobalFunction/GlobalFunctionLib/Base 
  - file src/GlobalFunction/GlobalFunctionLib/Base/CreateObject.php
  
- For more readable files, class names and code used them:
  - Interfaces have prefix I instead suffix Interface
  - Traits have prefix T instead suffix Trait
  - Abstract classes have prefix A instead prefix Abstract
            
- Some settings from .idea existed in repo for share setting 
  and equally inspect project together.    
    
# Resolutions of problems:
- set "classmap" in composer.json for auto generating map.
- PHPStorm's FileWatcher with command composer update. Run too often. (Exist in repo)
    - Sometimes(not relate of time after last execution) composer not update class map
      (but why?). For resolve repeat composer update few ones.
    - Need manual composer update (in PHPStorm: Tools->Composer->Update) 
      after create files or after edit class names or namespace.
- util/ILibGenerator generate interfaces for "middleware classes" 
  which has __call instead implementation of methods.      
- add @property for inerfaces and add related traits. Relate by @uses. 
  Interfaces and traits used both in abstract classes.
  
  Because: 
  - interfaces cat not have $properties. 
  - php classes can not extend more than 1 parent class.
  
  Example:
  - IHasAnimalCollection
  - THasAnimalCollection
  - AZoo
  
# Directory structure of project:
- public Place for accessible files for web server
- src/Ability Library of animal abilities. 
  What animals can do and what default action for ability.
- src/ActionFunction Implementation of actions, not only for animal.
- src/ActionObject Library of actions.
  What can to do with animal, what ability animal need for available run action.
- src/GlobalFunction Main library of functions.
- src/LifeCycle Library of object's life cycles.
  What object to do step by step.
- src/Object Other no sorted entities.
- util Place for console utility for code support.
- test/Mock Examples/Mocks for tests.
- test/Provider - combine and prepare mocks for use in tests.

# Main files:
- public/index.php Main entry point.
- util/ILibGenerator.php Generate interfaces for possible IDE auto complete methods 
  of some classes as GlobalFunction, ActionFunction.
- ALib Realise 1 file = 1 class = 1 method. Any subdirectories for group files. 
  Subdirectories have not any affect. They increase usefully search necessaries files.
- src/ActionObject/TNeedVerifyAvailable Control availability run action on objects.
  Include to necessary "ActionObjects" as Walk.
- test/TestCase.php It is parent only for base test of classes.
- apache.conf Available run script by browser. Used by Dockerfile.
- composer.json Autoloader by class map, provide phpunit.
- Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml Available easy run project on clear machine, 
  test minimal requirements.
- phpunit.xml Check covering by tests. Where are tests, how load them.
  
# Todo:
- usable builders
- usable naming
- usable directory hierarchy
- review todo in files
- add time step for life cycle process
